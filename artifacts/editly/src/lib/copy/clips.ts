/**
 * The clip library.
 *
 * One file per screen, and that is a bundling decision as much as a filing
 * one. The copy table was a single module, and a single module is a single
 * unit to a bundler: `not-found.tsx` and the crash screen are in the first
 * chunk the landing page downloads, so importing one sentence from that module
 * pulled every sentence in the product into it — measured at 17kB of gzip, in
 * a chunk `tools/speed-test.mjs` holds under 200kB. Split, each screen's words
 * travel in that screen's chunk.
 *
 * The rules are in `lib/app-copy.ts`, which is the door to this folder and
 * explains what is deliberately not written here.

  /**
   * The clip-extraction screen.
   *
   * The words here changed for one reason: this section was being read as
   * "podcast editing", and it is not. It does one job, on one kind of input,
   * and the copy now says which. You point it at a long recording and it hands
   * back short posts. It does not edit an episode, it does not publish one, and
   * it is not where a two-hour take goes to be tidied.
   *
   * The title says the job rather than the artefact for the same reason. "Clips"
   * names what is on the screen; "take clips out of a recording" names what the
   * screen is for, and only one of those tells somebody standing in front of a
   * ninety-minute episode whether they are in the right place.
